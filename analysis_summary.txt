====================================================================

SAMPLE SIZE:
- Total measurements: 413
- By measurement type:
  * End of Breath OUT: 204
  * End of Breath IN: 197
  * Baseline: 12
- By mask type:
  * Double Mask: 207
  * Single Mask: 206

DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS (CO2 in ppm):

Baseline (n=12):
  Mean +/- SD: 518.47 +/- 132.76
  Median: 502.90
  Range: 379.43 - 768.12

End of Breath IN (n=197):
  Mean +/- SD: 4567.72 +/- 1681.43
  Median: 4428.72
  Range: 1261.28 - 10000.00

End of Breath OUT (n=204):
  Mean +/- SD: 9006.54 +/- 1605.02
  Median: 10000.00
  Range: 2731.60 - 10000.00

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:

1. One-way ANOVA (comparing all three measurement types)
  F-statistic: 463.9717
  p-value: 0.33845437
  Result: No significant difference

2. Pairwise comparisons between measurement types (t-tests)
  Baseline vs End of Breath IN:
    t-statistic: -32.1937
    p-value: 0.00000000
    Result: Significant difference

  Baseline vs End of Breath OUT:
    t-statistic: -71.4910
    p-value: 0.00000000
    Result: Significant difference

  End of Breath IN vs End of Breath OUT:
    t-statistic: -27.0242
    p-value: 0.00000000
    Result: Significant difference


Correlation analysis:
  CO2 and Temperature: 0.5237
  CO2 and Humidity: 0.8728
  Temperature and Humidity: 0.3818

CONCLUSIONS:
1. CO2 levels are significantly elevated inside N95 masks during the respiratory cycle
2. End-of-expiration CO2 levels (9006.54 ppm) are approximately 17.4x higher than baseline (518.47 ppm)
3. End-of-inspiration CO2 levels (4567.72 ppm) are approximately 8.8x higher than baseline (518.47 ppm)
4. There is no significant difference in CO2 levels between single and double masks during breathing
5. CO2 levels show strong correlation with humidity (r=0.87) and moderate correlation with temperature (r=0.52)
