Study Summary 
The study measured CO2 concentrations inside N95 masks during different phases of the respiratory cycle,
comparing single versus double mask configurations. 
Key Findings: 
Baseline CO2: 518.47 +/- 132.76 ppm
End of inspiration: 4567.72 +/- 1681.43 ppm
End of expiration: 9006.54 +/- 1605.02 ppm
CO2 levels are significantly elevated inside N95 masks during the respiratory cycle
End-of-expiration CO2 levels are approximately 17.4x higher than baseline
End-of-inspiration CO2 levels are approximately 8.8x higher than baseline
There is no significant difference in CO2 levels between single and double masks during breathing
CO2 levels show correlation with humidity (r=0.87) and temperature (r=0.52)
